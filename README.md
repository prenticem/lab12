JavaScript Canvas

### What does the <canvas> allow a developer to acheive?
The <canvas> element allows developers to create dynamic, interactive graphics and animations using JavaScript. It provides a drawing surface that can be manipulated with JavaScript to create custom graphics, animations, and visualizations, making it a powerful tool for creating engaging web applications and user interfaces.
### What is the importance of the closing `</canvas> tag?
The closing </canvas> tag is important because it tells the web browser where the canvas element ends. Without this tag, the browser would not know where the canvas element ends and other content on the page begins, which could cause rendering issues or unexpected behavior.
### Explain what the getContext() method does.
The getContext() method is a tool for creating custom graphics and visual effects using the <canvas> element in HTML. It allows developers to obtain a rendering context and use it to manipulate the canvas and render graphics and animations using JavaScript.
